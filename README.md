# CMD tool to look up german words <h3>

# Scraps words from [wiktionary](https://de.wiktionary.org) and [verben.de](https://www.verbformen.de) and can add words to a spaced repetition app called anki <h5>

# Motivation <h5>
I was fed up constantly looking up words, juggling between sites and dictionaries and looking up their examples. And memorizing the word, is a whole another story. So I created this cmd tool that lets you look up words, their declension, pronunciation and examples. And can add the word with its pronunciation to a app called anki.

# Requirement <h5>
- Python version 3.10 or higher
- Python packages: bs4, requests, termcolor, urllib
- To listen to audio you need MPV, and it should also be on your path
